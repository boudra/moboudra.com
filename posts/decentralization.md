I have been working as part of a DAO for a year now and have been closely observing the push for decentralization in the web space. One thing that has become apparent to me is that we humans, if left unchecked, tend to lean towards centralization.

The relationship between centralization and decentralization has always fascinated me. I've been wondering why we, as humans, gravitate towards centralization in our societal structures.

If you look at nature, it is mostly decentralized, there's no single entity making decisions or having authority over a system.

Although you could argue that living beings join forces to improve their chance of survival, I don't consider that centralization. Ant colonies are a great example: ants take care of the queen for the common good, but individual ants still make their own decisions and are not ruled by the queen. These individual decisions lead to emergent behavior, giving the impression that the ant colony itself is making decisions as a whole, but there's actually no centralized entity in charge. This pattern repeats itself in other places, such as forests, or even your own human body.

Humans, similarly to ants, we move to cities because we have a better chance of thriving as a community, but over time, we introduce central governments to that make decisions for us and we introduce centralized services like law enforcement. The same happens with the internet, it was created with the idea that everyone would be able to run their own servers, but this hasn't been the case. We have mostly centralized into a handful of services. It's more convenient to buy something on Amazon than to find a separate website that might not have your credit card or address details. Plus, the fact that so many people use the same service means economies of scale apply, and centralized services can offer the same products but at a much lower cost than services with less usage.

Even in web3, which is rooted in decentralization, a similar pattern emerges. Nowadays, all Ethereum transactions seem to go through a handful of gateway companies, and normal users don't really run their own nodes, but instead use centralized ones.

I don't think this is a problem with a specific human tendency towards centralization, but rather it's derived from the universal tendency to choose the path of least resistance.

I believe Ethereum is a step in the right direction, because at least, it gives us the power to decentralize systems and encode the rules of decentralization within the system itself, preventing our little human brains from messing things up, which is great.

So to me, the tendency towards centralization seems to be a UX problem. We should build decentralized systems that are as convenient to use as centralized ones, I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be possible, it just requires us to work together, which is easier said than done :)
