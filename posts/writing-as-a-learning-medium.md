<p>I believe that a good test that you understand a concept well is when you can break it down to its essence and teach it to someone.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think we understand something, but only when we try to explain it to someone we end up realizing that we didn't really have a good understanding of it.</p>

<p>Therefore explaining a concept to someone else is also a very good way to learn something ourselves. It shows you what you don't know and it forces us to self reflect and put concepts in our minds into words.</p>

<p>I find that writing your thoughts and ideas has a very similar effect, it's as if you're explaining something to an imaginary person.</p>

That is one of the reasons why I like writing, it's not just about communicating ideas, but also about learning.
