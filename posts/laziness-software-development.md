Laziness being a virtue is a common and frequent theme in software development. One of the most famous quotes by Bill Gates states:

> I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.

While this may be true, I don't think that the right conclusion to take from it is that being a lazy software developer who avoids effort is somehow better.

We often misunderstand laziness as always choosing the easy solution, which usually means the quickest solution that takes the least amount of effort.

I bought into this idea early in my career and now recognize that reframing laziness made me a much better developer.

It's easy to write new code that fulfills some current requirements; the hard part is ensuring it works well for times to come and that it's easy to maintain.

Nowadays I still consider myself lazy, but in a different way. I don't want to spend Friday evenings debugging buggy code, I also don't want to spend hours manually testing an application because a small change could break the whole thing.

We often don't stop to re-evaluate past design decisions or how to evolve the codebase to match new requirements. We usually design software when we first write it and then just tweak it to do the new thing we want it to do, so we end up with fragile software that is essentially a pile of quick fixes.

I'm not advocating to go to the other extreme and start spending days designing small changes to the codebase, but instead, to take a moment to think of the codebase as a constantly evolving entity and thoughtfully implement new requirements instead of just doing the bare minimum to get things working.
