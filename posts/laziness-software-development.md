Laziness being a good thing is a common and frequent theme in software development. One of the most famous quotes by Bill Gates states:

> I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.

While this may be true, I don't think that the right conclusion to take from it is that being a lazy software developer who avoids effort is somehow better.

We understand laziness as always choosing the easy solution, which usually means the quickest solution that takes the least amount of effort.

I now recognize that reframing laziness has made me a much better developer.

It's easy to write new code that fulfills some current requirements; the hard part is ensuring it works well for times to come and that it is easy to maintain.

It would be great to write software once and be done, but the reality is that most of the time software will need to be modified at some point or another, usually to fix problems or extend it's functionality, and when we do that, we often don't stop to re-evaluate past design decisions or how to evolve the codebase to match new requirements.

We usually design software when we first write it, and then just tweak it to do the new thing we want it to do, so we end up with fragile code that is essentially a pile of quick fixes, with a lot of complexity baggage and dependencies which might not be needed anymore.

Fragile code leads to buggy software that is hard to change, making for a frustrating user experience and slowing down the effectivenes of the people working on the software itself.

I still consider myself lazy, but in a different way. I don't want to spend Friday evenings debugging problems, I also don't want to spend hours manually testing an application because I fear a small change could break the whole thing.

I'm not advocating to over engineer the codebase and obsess over code quality, at the end of the day, code is a means to an end and that end always takes priority in my opinion. Just be strategically lazy, when possible, focus on reducing future effort, not current effort.

Take a moment to think about how you can improve the codebase for your future self and everyone else working on it, not just about how to implement the current thing by doing the bare minimum.
