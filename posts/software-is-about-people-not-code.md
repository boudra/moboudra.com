title: "Building Exceptional Software is About People"
description: "In the world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the lines of code and technical challenges. However, we must remember that software development is fundamentally about people."

In the initial months of my management role, I was mostly still thinking like a developer, my focus was always on the code. Whenever there was a problem, technical or not, my immediate response was to come up with a technical solution. I was mostly supporting the team with mentoring, facilitating design discussions and such. Those things, while still important, are not the way to build exceptional software.

It wasn't until later that I realized the biggest impact I could have to the team was with focusing on the people aspect, this might sound obvious to some, but I think coming from an engineering background this is a difficult shift to do, and I've noticed that this is a common issue with new engineering managers, they find it hard to turn off their "developer brain".

I believe the core issue is that as developers we value hard skills and knowledge above all else, such as knowing all the best practices or mastering your stack. While those things are important, I now believe that focusing on building a supportive environment where feedback is easily given and taken, where growth is encouraged is a much more powerful thing to be focusing your time on because, with time and patience you ultimately will get better software.

If you break down how developers spend their time building software, a lot of it is spent coordinating with the team, not writing code in isolation, tasks like figuring out how existing code works, designing and deciding how we are going to build and deliver new features, sharing knowledge with teammates etc. Therefore it is fundamental that the team is able do these activities effectively, and your job as a manager is to create an environment where that's possible.

The software might be the end product, but it's the team that builds it, so focus on the team.
