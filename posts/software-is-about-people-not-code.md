title: "Software is About People"
description: "In the world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the lines of code and technical challenges. However, we must remember that software development is fundamentally about people."

In my first year in a mangement position, I was mostly still thinking like a developer, my focus was always on the code. Whenever there was a problem, technical or not, my immediate response was find a solution by throwing code at it. I was mostly supporting the team with mentoring, facilitating design discussions and such.

It wasn't until later that I realized the biggest impact I could have to the team was with focusing on the people aspect, this might sound obvious to some, but I think coming from an engineering background this is a difficult shift, and I've noticed that this is a common issue with new engineering managers, they find it hard to turn off their "developer brain".

I believe the core issue is that as developers we value hard skills and knowledge above all else, such as knowing all the best practices or mastering your stack. While those things are important, I now believe that focusing on building a supportive environment where feedback is easily given and taken, where growth is encouraged is a much more powerful thing to be focusing your time on because, with time and patience you ultimately will get better software.

Lately I haven't been working in managment positions as much, but these are all learnings that I take with me, and it means that regardless of my role I prioritize positive team dynamics, because the best way to get exceptional software is through empathy, understanding, and mutual support.
