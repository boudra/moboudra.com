title: "Software is About People"
description: "In the world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the lines of code and technical challenges. However, we must remember that software development is fundamentally about people."

When I first started building software, my focus was always on the code. Whenever there was a problem, technical or not, my immediate response was find a solution by throwing code at it.

I realise now that software development is not really about the code itself, but about people. The code comes after.

Software is built by people, for people. And when it comes to people, there is no soft skill more essential than empathy.

Empathy towards our teammates is crucial to build great software. By embracing empathy within our team, we can create and environment of collaboration, support, and shared understanding.

Equally significant is empathy towards end users, while writing code can be fun in itself and can be an outlet for intellectual stimulation and creativity (and it's totally okay to build software just for the sake of it), we have to remember that code is just a tool, a means to an end.

The primary purpose of code is to build software that is useful and impactful. That's why it's important to strike a balance between the technical aspects of coding and the software's intended impact.

It is a natural tendency to develop tunnel vision and become overly focused on the codebase, losing sight of the fact that our efforts should ultimately result in a meaningful impact for the end user.

One way to put this into practice is to consistently ask how your actions impact the rest of the team and the end users, and prioritize accordingly.

# Putting it into practice

I think when you put empathy at forefront of everything you do in software development, a lot of the practices that the industry agrees are "good", happen automatically:

- **Prioritize user impact**: Focus on tasks that directly improve the end user's experience, if it doesn't, reconsider it's priority.
- **User research:** Consider different user perspectives and conduct user research.
- **Maintainable code**: Write code thinking about the person who will be maintaining it later, make sure it's easy to understand. If you have to take a shortcut and implement less than ideal code, find a way to communicate it.
- **Test implementations**: Invest time in proper manual and automated testing to identify issues early on, and save your teammates from late-night or weekend debugging sessions down the line.
- **Make your code easy to review**: Provide clear descriptions of the changes you're making and keep the scope of the changes small to facilitate code reviews and collaboration.
- **Practice empathy in code reviews**: Offer constructive feedback and consider the context and challenges faced by the developer.
- **Ask for help**: It's okay to not to know things, you have teammates for a reason, ask for help.
- **Practice active listening**: Truly listen to your teammates and value their perspectives.
- **Over communicate**: Openly share progress and challenges with the team to improve transparency and collaboration.

I am a big believer that when embracing empathy, building impactful software is inevitable.
