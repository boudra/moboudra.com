In the world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the lines of code and technical challenges. However, we must remember that software development is fundamentally about people.

Software is built by people, for people. As software developers, the most important thing we can do, is to empathize with our own teammates and the end users.

Writing code can be fun in itself, it can be an outlet for creativity and intellectual stimulation, but code is just a tool, a means to an end.

It is a natural tendency to develop tunnel vision and become overly focused on the codebase, losing sight of the fact that our efforts should ultimately result in a meaningful impact for the end user.

The primary purpose of code is to build software that is useful and impactful. That's why it's important to strike a balance between the technical aspects of coding and the software's intended impact.

The impact of software is directly linked to the usefulness of its functionality, which in turn, is a reflection of the capabilities of team that developed it.

Ultimately, the key to create impactful software is to build a strong and collaborative team, a team that collectively strive to build the right thing, and their members prioritize the impact of their work over the code itself, empathize with each other and the end users they serve.
