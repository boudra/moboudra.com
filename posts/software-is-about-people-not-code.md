In the world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the lines of code and technical challenges. However, we must remember that software development is fundamentally about people.

Software is built by people, for people. As software developers, it is important for us to empathize with both our colleagues building with us, and the end-users.

Writing code can be fun in itself, it can be an outlet for creativity and intellectual stimulation, but code is just a tool, a means to an end.

The primary purpose of code is to create software that is useful and impactful. That's why it's important to strike a balance between the technical aspects of coding and the software's intended impact.

The impact of software is directly linked to the quality of its functionality, which in turn, is a reflection of the capabilities of team that developed it. Building excellent software begins with the team that develops it.

Ultimately, the key to create impactful software is to build a strong and collaborative team, a team where their members prioritize the impact of ther work over the code itself, empathize with each other and the end-users they serve.
